```
========================================
           TELEGRAM SCRAPER
========================================
[S] Scrape channels
[C] Continuous scraping  
[M] Media scraping: ON
[L] List & add channels
[R] Remove channels
[E] Export data
[T] Rescrape media
[Q] Quit
========================================
```

### Channel Selection Made Easy 🔢

Instead of typing long channel IDs, use numbers:

**Adding Channels:**
```
[1] The News (Chat) (id: -1002116176890)
[2] Python Channel (id: -1001597139842)
[3] The Corner (id: -1002274713954)

Enter: 1,3 (adds channels 1 and 3)
```

**Scraping Channels:**
- Single: `1`
- Multiple: `1,3,5` 
- All: `all`
- Mix formats: `1,-1001597139842,3`

## Data Storage 💾

### Database Structure

Data is stored in SQLite databases, one per channel:
- Location: `./channelname/channelname.db`
- Optimized with indexes for fast queries
- WAL mode for better performance

### Media Storage 📁

Media files are stored with unique naming:
- Location: `./channelname/media/`
- Format: `{message_id}-{unique_id}-{original_name}.ext`
- **No more file overwrites** - Each file gets a unique name

### Exported Data 📊

Export formats:
1. **CSV**: `./channelname/channelname.csv`
2. **JSON**: `./channelname/channelname.json`

## Performance Features ⚙️

- **5 concurrent downloads** for faster media processing
- **Batch database operations** for optimal speed
- **Progress bars** with real-time feedback
- **Resume capability** - Continue where you left off
- **Memory-efficient** exports for large datasets

## Error Handling 🛠️

- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Rate limit compliance
- Network error recovery
- State preservation during interruptions

## Limitations ⚠️

- Respects Telegram's rate limits
- Can only access public channels or channels you're a member of
- Media download size limits apply as per Telegram's restrictions

  ```
  python telegram-scraper.py
  ```
